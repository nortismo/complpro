# Random Generators

## Requirements

- Independent (i.e. uncorrelated to previous realizations)
- Uniformly distributed
- High resolution (no gaps)
- No cycles
- Fast and memory friendly creation
- Reproducibility (seed)

The series of random numbers should be reproducible to reproduce situations.

## Linear congruency method

Fulfills the above requirements. See slide 100.
