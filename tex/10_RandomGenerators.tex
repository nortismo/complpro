\subsection{Requirements}\label{requirements}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Independent (i.e.~uncorrelated to previous realizations)
\item
  Uniformly distributed
\item
  High resolution (no gaps)
\item
  No cycles
\item
  Fast and memory friendly creation
\item
  Reproducibility (seed)
\end{itemize}

The series of random numbers should be reproducible to reproduce
situations.

\subsection{Linear congruency method}\label{linear-congruency-method}}

Fulfills the above requirements. See slide 100.
