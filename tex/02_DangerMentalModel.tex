\begin{verbatim}
Our theories are our inventions, but they may be merely il-reasoned guesses, bold conjectures, hypotheses. Out of these we create a world: not the real world, but our own nets which we try to catch the real world.

By dealing with models, the human tends to believe the most complex
model is correct. It's essential to stick to the simplest available
model, unless it's proven wrong.

Prejustice is also a big issue (D.L. Rosehans experiment).

Question)}\label{causality-vs.correlation-mep-question}}

\textbf{Correlation}\\
Two factors are correlated if a mathematical dependency between them can
be statistically proven.\\
\emph{Can be proven statistically}

\textbf{Causality}\\
There is a casual relationship between two factors if a cause-effect
relationship exists between the two.

-\textgreater{} Correlation can be proven, strictly speaking causality
cannot.\\
\emph{Can not be proven}

\item
  Superstitiousness (ticket machine on the bus)
\item
  Prejudices (Rosenhan experiment)
\item
  Mental model can generate their own momentum (selective search after
  confirmation)
\item
  Conservatism: Mental models develop based on experience
\item
  False security: If mental models are not perceived as such they are
  not questioned.

First of all, mental models cannot be verified!
