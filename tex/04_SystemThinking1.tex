The following picture shows a casual model of a fish population in a
limited biosphere.

\textbf{Positive polarity:}\\
Increases (decreases) cause, then increases (decreases) effect.

\textbf{Negative polarity:}\\
Increases (decreases) cause, then decreases (increases) effect.

\textbf{Reinforcing Loop:}\\
The reinforcement increases the initial effect. A loop is reinforced
when the number of minuses is even. e.g.~if I put additional fishes into
the population.

\textbf{Balancing Loop:}\\
The feedback balances the initial effect. A loop is balanced if the
number of minuses are odd.

The following picture shows a casual loop diagram.
