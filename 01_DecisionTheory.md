There are two perspectivs on the decision theory. The __descriptive decision theory__ describes the thoughts over the whole situation and the decision making. 

The __normative decision theory__ contains thoughs like how are people making decisions and what could be the outcome. What could be the possibilities or the options? 

## Decriptive Decision Theory
- Intuitive and rational decisions
- Mental models

__Rational decisions__ are __targeted throughout__ and __goal oriented__. They follow a __systematic procedure__ and __uses a clear methodological rules__ (which is understandable from not involved people). These decisions are __not from gut feeling__ and are __not intuitiv__. 

The fundamental of a __intuitive decision__ is the __knowledge__ you have and __the experience of everything__ you ever experienced or of happenings and knowledge you earned from other people. Decisions made out of __gut feeling__.

A __mental model__ is a __simplified mental description__ of the subjective awereness of the outside world with the purpose of 
- __handling the large quantity of information__
- in order to be able to __make decisions quickly__

e.g. If your coin doesn't get accepted in the vendor machine, you need to rub it on the surface of the machine and try it again. And if this works, it even strengthen your mental model, but actually this process with the coin doesn't help in any way. 

Second example: You try to cross the road and you are at the edge of the sidewalk. If there are no noise, you are able to cross the road. But no noise is actually not a proof that the street if safe to cross.

Mental models are __made of__ 
- __Subconscious__
- __By experience__ in the past
- and they are adapted to specific situations immediately

    Learning is nothing else than adapting mental models.
    If you are not able to adapt mental models, you are not able to make decisions quickly.
