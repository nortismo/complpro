# Normative Decision Theory
The __normative decision theory is more rational__. E.g. if you want to a maximum of profit and you have the options to open a store with 125,000 CHF profit and another store with 150,000 CHF profit, you decide for the second one __on a rational basis__.

The __main subject__ of the normative decision theory is not conflicting target but rather __uncertainty__ (ger: Ungewissheit). 

## Result / Decision Matrix
The mineral oil company is aware that a large-scale bypass is planned but that this is highly controversial. 
- It wouldn't affect the traffic in the town centre and the expected profit would remain at CHF 125,000.
- However, there would be a drastic change to the outskirts of town which would bring the expected profit down to CHF 80,000.

__Rresults matrix:__ The form of depiction for decisions involving uncertainty, where the alternativ actions (ai) are depicted in the rows and the different environmental conditions in the columns (zi). 

![Results Matrix](figures/resultMatrix.png)

The decision matrix only describes the decision situation if the state space is recorded in full. So if there are changes on the environment in future, you can not involve that in your decision.

## Decision with probabilities
__Decision involving risk:__ If occurrence likelihoods can be assigned to environmental conditions. 
__Decision involving uncertainty:__ If no occurrence likelihoods can be assigned to environmental conditions. 

*Probabilitis must not only be mathematically or statistically sound (objective probabilities), but rather may also only result from the subjective view of the decision maker (subjective probabilities).*

## Dominance
An alternative is described as __dominant__ if it is to be preferred over another alternativ in all cases. If an alternative dominates all others, it must be preferred on rational grounds. 

__Absolute dominance__: If the worst result value of the dominating alternative is better than the best result value of the dominating alternative. 

__Circumstantial dominance__: One alternative in every circumstance (environmental circumstance) is better than (or equally good as) the other alternative.

*In this figure, there is no absolute dominance, because a1 is not better in every situation than the best of a2. There is no circumstantial dominance, because a1 is better, regardless of the environmental conditions.*

__Target dominance__:  If a target is considered to be a decisiv one, the fulfilment of all other targets can be put aside.

### Different Target 
- __Complementary targets__: By pursuing one target, the other target is also (optimally) achieved. 
- __Neutral targets__: Don't influence each other. 
- __Competing targets__: Realising one target impacts on reaching the other target.

## Lexiocographical order
In lexiocographical order you put priorities to some criterias (e.g. first priority = Sales, second priority = Environmental damage). All options will be sorted according to the priorities (primary key and secondary key) and the one on the top wins.

## Utility function (Nutzwertanalyse)
Weigthns the different parameters (e.g. the factor for profit is higher than for revenue). Afterwards the variant with the biggest utility is the one to be choosen.
