# Intro

A complex system is hard to simplify or cannot be simplified at all.

## Complicated vs. complex system

A __complex system__ has a lot of elements and it's difficult to explain the system, but not because of the elements. The problem is the correlation between the elements. It's not possible to cut the system into subsystems due to loops. It would change the behaviour of the system.  
_Example: Company_  
It's not possible to understand a company if you'll only know a part of it.

If a system has many elements and is therefore not easy to explain, we have a __complicated system__. A complicated system is "reducible" by cutting it into small systems (subsystems), which can be explained.  
_Example: Car_  
It's a complicated system, but the engine can be analysed seperatly (or even be splited into more subsystems).

## Features of a complex system

There are no typical features of a complex system, but it often shows the following properties:

- High number of elements
-  Non-linear interactions between the elements
- Delayed effects
- Negative and positive feedback
- Network-like structure
- Open
- Universal
- Dynamic
- Robust
- Creative and innovative
- Unpredictable
- Differentiated sensitivity
- Not monitorable

## Models and simulation

To manage complexity it is required to build models. A model is a simplified description of reality.  
The usefulness of a model is, to test changes within a model and transfer the gained knowledge to the real world. If this is not possible, the model is useless.  
A model must be as accurate as required, but an overengineered model is also useless. Details must be erased by a model.  
A model has boundaries it cannot be used for simulations it's not intended to!

The usage of a model to determine how things are going to act in a certain situation (in all likelihood), is called __simulation__.
