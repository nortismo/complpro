# Dangers of mental models

    Our theories are our inventions, but they may be merely il-reasoned guesses, bold conjectures, hypotheses. Out of these we create a world: not the real world, but our own nets which we try to catch the real world.

By dealing with models, the human tends to believe the most complex model is correct. It's essential to stick to the simplest available model, unless it's proven wrong.

Prejustice is also a big issue (D.L. Rosehans experiment).

## Causality vs. correlation

__Correlation__  
Two factors are correlated if a mathematical dependency between them can be statistically proven.

__Causality__  
There is a casual relationship between two factors if a cause-effect relationship exists between the two.

-> Correlation can be proven, strictly speaking causality cannot.

## Problems of mental models

1. Superstitiousness (ticket machine on the bus)
1. Prejudices (Rosenhan experiment)
1. Mental model can generate their own momentum (selective search after confirmation)
1. Conservatism: Mental models develop based on experience
1. False security: If mental models are not perceived as such they are not questioned.

## Handle mental models

First of all, mental models cannot be verified!

1. Become familiar with your own mental models, make mental models explicit
1. Critical thinking
1. Exchanging information about mental models
